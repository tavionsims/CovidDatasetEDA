***COVID Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the COVID dataset using Python. The dataset is obtained using the covid library and various visualization techniques are applied to understand and analyze the data.

***Getting Started***
***Prerequisites***
Ensure you have the following installed:

1. Python (>=3.6)

2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Required libraries: covid, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
4. Installation
5. To install the covid library, run the following command:
  - pip install covid


Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook Covid_Dataset.ipynb.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and generate the visualizations.
3. Explore the analysis and insights provided.

***Contents***
   
- Downloading the COVID dataset: Installing the covid library and importing necessary modules.

- Querying Data: Examples of querying data, including getting status by country name and total confirmed cases.

- Data Visualization: Various visualization techniques applied to understand the dataset, including line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and pie charts.


This analysis is based on the data provided by Johns Hopkins University.

The covid library simplifies accessing and querying COVID-19 data.
